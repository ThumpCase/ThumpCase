      <h2>The ThumpCase Story</h2>
      As one of the original founders of Boomcase.com with over 8 years of work experience on the Boomase team I have personally assitsted in the design and building of over 1000 portable sound systems. ThumpCase was born as logistic reasons caused the original boomcase team to be forced to split. Rather than try and work togther over long distances we decided to split into two companies so that we could give our customers the highest quality products. The ThumpCase vision is to give big sound in a small package with the highest audiophile quality possible.

      <h2>Sound Quality</h2>
      Each ThumpCase is built using quality drivers, a unique handmade crossover and is acoustically designed to compliment the speakers used. The ThumpCase team has over 20+ years of combined audio building experience. Every ThumpCase is rigorously tested for 2+ days to audiophile sound quality standards before shipping out.
